            I designed this web site so that i can develop my skills in programing and application course
            as a practice i have done a small scale web design with four components
        </p>
    To do this web site i first installed the visual studio code. once i created a new folder i created a
    a other html and css files inside the folder which served me as source code. After that i wrote my code using emmet intensively. 
    <p>the html is the standard markup
        language for creating web pages and web applications.  it is basically web version of word document. since i had to 
        to display my content on the web i had to write syntax with the basic requirements of a normal text structures such as: headers, lines, paragraphs, body
        these tags have angle brackets which serves as opening and closing.The html have a structure where elements are placed
         as Root Elements and Nested Elements (chilled and body elements),
         for example: the body element will have paragraphs and the paragraphs will have lists, etc.  
           </p>
           <p>
               I used css for style sheet. css is a styling language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language like HTMl. out of the three method to code css i used the external
                css. I executed the external css method  by separating the CSS file and saving it in a similar directory 
                 main html file. To be referenced for styling of my layout work in the main html code.To give style to each components tags a paragraphs all i needed to do was give an id to any component on the html file then write tha id on css with a "#" in front others like image can be inserted by saving it on the folder first and once it saved it could be inserted by ebtering the source "src" option 
           </p>
           <p>To work with HTML and CSS i used chrome browser</p>
